        <h2 class="review-title">Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson (2023)</h2>
        <span class="rating">Rating: 5/5</span>
        <span class="review-date"><em>Review written 26 December 2024</em></span>
        
        <div class="review-body">
            <p>Shadowing Musk for two years, Isaacson provides a remarkably intimate account of Musk's life and work. According to Isaacson, Musk made no effort to alter the biography or even view it when it was in the works, resulting in an unbiased portrayal of both the good and the bad Musk's character.</p>
            
            <p>The book neither leaned too much towards being a chronicle of Musk's life nor a portrait of his personality. Isaacson wove observations about Musk's character into discussions of specific events.</p>
            
            <p>Musk is incredibly impulsive and stubborn – traits traditionally regarded as "negative". While this has led to some rash decisions, it has also enabled him to accomplish what few others could. Musk often makes allegedly "impossible" demands of his employees, which, much of the time, end up being possible. The threshold for perceived possibility in technology appears to generally be lower than actual possibility.</p>
            
            <p>Musk's self-described "maniacal sense of urgency" is clearly not conducive for happy employees. While his employees risk burnout, humanity reaps the benefits of his companies (with some exceptions). Efficiency and employee satisfaction seem, in this book, to be inversely proportional.</p>
            
            <p>The greatest issue with the book (although the book contained no significant flaws), for me, was the discrepancy of coverage for different periods. This is, of course, understandable – the periods where Isaacson shadowed Musk are bound to be far more comprehensive. However, I would have liked to have learnt, in more detail, about Musk's life in the mid 2010s. It is quite possible that no major developments occurred during this period, so it simply wasn't good writing material.</p>
            
            <p>Musk's traumatic childhood obviously played a role in shaping his character – the extent to which Isaacson attempts to portray Musk as resembling his abusive father (Errol) seems to be more of an attempt to create engagement than a legitimate assessment of character. I don't doubt that Errol affected Musk – whether this led to Musk unconsciously "mirroring" him, as opposed to their behaviors occasionally being similar, seems unlikely to me. A smaller issue was that there were a few minor errors (for example writing "China" instead of "Crimea") scattered throughout.</p>
            
            <p>However, the book was thorough, engaging, nuanced, and extremely well written. The time jumps (which I usually don't like) were employed perfectly, maintaining a sense of continuity while also highlighting aspects of Musk's character, and minimizing complexity.</p>
